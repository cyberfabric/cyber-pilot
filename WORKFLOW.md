# FDD Workflow System

**Version**: 2.0  
**Purpose**: Define roles, layers, workflows, and sequences in FDD methodology

---

## FDD Core Principles

### Agent-Optimized Design

**All FDD files MUST be optimized for AI agents**:
- **Brevity**: Minimal text, maximum information density
- **Imperative language**: Direct commands, not suggestions
- **Mandatory markers**: MUST, REQUIRED, SHALL for obligations
- **OS-agnostic**: No OS-specific commands or paths
- **Structured format**: Parseable sections, consistent headers

### FDD Adapter Concept

**FDD Adapter is OPTIONAL**:
- Workflows work with sensible defaults without adapter
- Adapter required only when customization needed
- Adapter auto-triggers when user touches customization details

**Adapter Structure**:
- Primary file: `{adapter-directory}/AGENTS.md`
- Format: ALWAYS ... WHEN instructions (like FDD/AGENTS.md)
- Content: Navigation to adapter-specific configuration files
- Purpose: Project-specific conventions, formats, paths

**Adapter Auto-Trigger Rules**:
- Agent ALWAYS stop and run `adapter` workflow WHEN:
  - User specifies domain model format/location
  - User specifies API contract format/location
  - User specifies custom file structures
  - User specifies project-specific conventions
  - Any customization beyond FDD defaults required

**Without Adapter**:
- Product Manager workflows work fully (business context is generic)
- Architect workflows work partially (defaults for structure)
- Feature workflows work partially (generic templates)
- Implementation workflows REQUIRE adapter (code conventions needed)

### Workflow Types

**Operation Workflows** (Type: Operation):
- Create or update documents/code
- Include user interactions (questions, proposals)
- ALWAYS open and follow `core.md` WHEN creating or modifying FDD core files changes
- Run validation workflow after completion

**Validation Workflows** (Type: Validation):
- Validate structure and consistency
- Fully automated (no user interaction)
- Use requirements files as source of truth
- Output results to chat (no report files)

### Validation Requirements

**Every validation ALWAYS do check**:
1. **Structure**: Compliance with requirements file structure
2. **Non-contradiction**: No conflicts with dependency artifacts
3. **Coverage**: All requirements from dependencies addressed
4. **Completeness**: No placeholders, all IDs valid, all sections present

**Formula**: `B includes all of A, B follows Structure, B doesn't contradict A or Structure`

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Project Manager

**Controls**: All steps, all layers, adapter creation (when needed)

**Artifacts**:
- FDD Adapter configuration (optional, only when customization required)
- Project structure

**Workflows**:
- `adapter` - Create/configure FDD adapter from scratch (auto-triggered on customization)
- `adapter-from-sources` - Create/configure FDD adapter by analyzing existing codebase
- `adapter-agents` - Configure AI agent integration (Windsurf, Cursor, etc.)

## Typical Workflow Sequences

### New Project from Scratch

```
adapter 
→ adapter-validate 
→ business-context 
→ business-validate 
→ design 
→ design-validate 
→ features 
→ features-validate 
→ feature (for each feature)
→ feature-validate 
→ feature-changes 
→ feature-changes-validate 
 → feature-change-implement (for each change)
 → feature-code-validate
 → Next feature or complete
```

### Add Feature to Existing Project

```
[DESIGN.md already validated]
→ features (update FEATURES.md)
→ features-validate 
→ feature (new feature)
→ feature-validate 
→ feature-changes 
→ feature-changes-validate 
 → feature-change-implement (for each change)
 → feature-code-validate
```

### Fix Design Issue During Implementation

```
[During feature-change-implement, design issue found]
→ design (update DESIGN.md)
→ design-validate 
→ feature (update feature DESIGN.md)
→ feature-validate 
→ feature-changes (update CHANGES.md if needed)
→ feature-changes-validate 
→ feature-change-implement (continue)
```

### Product Manager Control Point

```
[After design created by Architect]
→ design-validate (Architect validates structure + business alignment)
→ [If FAIL: Architect fixes design]
→ [If PASS: Proceed to features]
```

### Removed

- ❌ OpenSpec (replaced with feature/CHANGES.md)
- ❌ openspec/ directory structure
- ❌ openspec-* workflows
- ❌ Multi-phase numbering (01-init-project, 02-validate, etc.)

### Added

- ✅ Role-based workflow organization
- ✅ BUSINESS.md as separate artifact (Layer 2)
- ✅ feature/CHANGES.md (replaces openspec/changes/)
- ✅ Clear validation prerequisites
- ✅ Control workflows for cross-role validation
- ✅ Explicit layer hierarchy

### Changed

- 🔄 Workflow naming: Descriptive names (not numbered)
- 🔄 Validation: Always after operation, uses requirements files
- 🔄 Prerequisites: Explicit validation dependencies
- 🔄 DESIGN.md: Now depends on BUSINESS.md

## Validation Chain

```
adapter-validate
    ↓
business-validate
    ↓
design-validate (checks BUSINESS.md)
    ↓
features-validate (checks DESIGN.md)
    ↓
feature-validate (checks DESIGN.md + FEATURES.md)
    ↓
 feature-changes-validate (checks feature DESIGN.md)
    ↓
 feature-code-validate (validates entire feature code vs feature design)
```

**Rule**: Every artifact MUST be validated before dependent artifacts can be created
