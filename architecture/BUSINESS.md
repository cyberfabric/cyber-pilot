# Business Context: FDD

## A. Vision

**Purpose**: FDD (Feature-Driven Design) is a universal methodology for building software systems with complete traceability from business requirements to implementation. It enables development teams to design before coding, validate designs systematically, and integrate seamlessly with AI coding assistants through structured workflows and machine-readable specifications.

**Target Users**:
- Development Teams - Building software with clear design documentation
- Technical Leads & Architects - Defining system architecture and technical decisions
- Product Managers - Capturing business requirements and use cases
- AI Coding Assistants - Executing workflows and validating artifacts
- QA Engineers - Verifying implementation matches design
- Documentation Writers - Creating comprehensive technical documentation

**Key Problems Solved**:
- **Design-Code Disconnect**: Code diverges from design without single source of truth, leading to outdated documentation
- **Lack of Traceability**: Cannot track business requirements through design to implementation, making impact analysis difficult
- **Unstructured Development**: No repeatable process for design and implementation, causing inconsistent quality
- **AI Integration Challenges**: AI agents cannot follow methodology without structured guidance and machine-readable specifications
- **Validation Complexity**: Manual design reviews are time-consuming and miss structural issues

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% design-code traceability through FDD IDs and code tags (@fdd-* markers)
- 20+ executable workflows covering entire development lifecycle (operation + validation)
- Validation accuracy ≥95% (deterministic validators catch structural issues before manual review)
- Support any tech stack through adapter system (zero forced technology choices)
- AI agents can execute workflows autonomously with minimal human intervention
