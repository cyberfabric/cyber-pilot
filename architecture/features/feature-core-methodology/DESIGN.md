# Feature Design: Core Methodology Framework

## A. Feature Context

**Feature ID**: `fdd-fdd-feature-core-methodology`

**Feature Directory**: `architecture/features/feature-core-methodology/`

**References**:
- `architecture/features/FEATURES.md` entry: `fdd-fdd-feature-core-methodology`
- Overall Design: `architecture/DESIGN.md`

### 1. Overview

The Core Methodology Framework is the foundation of FDD, providing the structure files, workflow specifications, and navigation system that enable design-first development. It defines artifact structures through requirements files, guides execution through workflow files, and enables AI agent navigation through the AGENTS.md system.

### 2. Purpose

To establish a technology-agnostic, extensible methodology framework that enables:
- Structured artifact creation with validation
- AI-driven workflow execution
- Progressive disclosure for human and machine consumption
- Version-controlled design evolution

This feature solves the problem of inconsistent design documentation by providing formal structure requirements and executable workflows that both humans and AI agents can follow reliably.

### 3. Actors

- `fdd-fdd-actor-architect` - Defines project architecture using FDD methodology
- `fdd-fdd-actor-developer` - Implements features following FDD workflows
- `fdd-fdd-actor-ai-assistant` - Executes workflows autonomously via AGENTS.md navigation

## E. Technical Details

### Database Schema

**N/A** - Core methodology uses file-based artifacts (Markdown files), no database required. All state is in Git-versioned files.

### API Endpoints

**N/A** - Core methodology is not a web service. Accessed via file system operations and workflow execution.

**Future consideration**: HTTP API for IDE integrations to query workflow status, validate artifacts remotely, or trigger workflows from external tools.

### Security

**File System Permissions**:
- All artifacts stored as files in project directory
- Protected by OS-level file permissions
- Inherited from parent directory permissions

**No Authentication/Authorization**:
- Local tool running with user's permissions
- No network requests or external API calls
- No centralized access control required

**No Sensitive Data**:
- All artifacts are design documentation
- Public within project team
- Version controlled via Git with standard access controls

**Threat Model**:
- **Threat**: Malicious modification of workflow files
  - **Mitigation**: Git version control with code review
- **Threat**: Unauthorized access to design artifacts
  - **Mitigation**: Repository access controls (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- **Threat**: Execution of untrusted workflows
  - **Mitigation**: User reviews all workflow steps; no automatic code execution

### Error Handling

**File Not Found**:
- **Detection**: File read operation fails with file not found error
- **Response**: Graceful error message with full file path
- **Guidance**: "Run prerequisite workflow X" or "Check file path"
- **Example**: "BUSINESS.md not found at architecture/BUSINESS.md. Run 'fdd business for PROJECT' first."

**Invalid Structure**:
- **Detection**: Validation algorithm finds missing/malformed sections
- **Response**: Validation report with specific issues
- **Guidance**: Fix recommendations with section requirements
- **Example**: "Section B missing. Add ## B. Actor Flows per requirements/feature-design-structure.md"

**Parse Errors**:
- **Detection**: Markdown parsing fails or unexpected format
- **Response**: Error message with line number and context
- **Guidance**: Show expected format vs actual format
- **Example**: "Line 42: Expected '## C. Algorithms' heading, found '### Algorithms'"

**Missing Prerequisites**:
- **Detection**: Workflow checks prerequisite artifacts
- **Response**: Clear error with workflow dependency chain
- **Guidance**: List of prerequisite workflows to run
- **Example**: "Prerequisite failed: DESIGN.md must exist and pass validation (≥90/100). Run 'fdd design for PROJECT' first."

### Integration Points

**Git Version Control**:
- All FDD artifacts are plain Markdown files
- Fully compatible with Git workflows (branch, merge, diff)
- Enables collaboration through pull requests
- Design evolution tracked in commit history

**Text Editors and IDEs**:
- Markdown files editable in any text editor
- No special tooling required for viewing/editing
- Syntax highlighting available in most modern editors
- Optional IDE extensions for enhanced navigation (future)

**CI/CD Pipelines**:
- fdd validation commands can run in CI checks
- Fail builds if artifacts don't pass validation thresholds
- Generate validation reports as build artifacts
- Example: `python3 scripts/fdd.py validate --artifact architecture/DESIGN.md`

**AI Coding Assistants**:
- AGENTS.md navigation designed for Claude, Windsurf, and similar tools
- WHEN clause pattern enables context-aware spec loading
- Structured prompts in workflow files guide AI execution
- Deterministic validation provides clear pass/fail signals

**Description**: The system SHALL enforce design artifact creation before implementation. Structure validation SHALL run automatically after artifact generation. Validation SHALL use pass thresholds (≥90 or 100/100) that block progression if not met. Prerequisites in workflows SHALL enforce ordering (BUSINESS before DESIGN before FEATURES before implementation). Design artifacts SHALL be single source of truth with code following specifications.

## G. Additional Context

### FDL Implementation Approach

**Note**: This feature's FDL instructions are implemented through **behavioral specifications** rather than traditional code:

- **Navigation algorithms** (`algo-navigate-when`, `algo-resolve-workflow`): Implemented via AGENTS.md rules and user_rules in AI prompts
- **Artifact generation** (`algo-generate-artifact`, `algo-validate-structure`): Implemented in validator script (`fdd.py`) and workflow files
- **User onboarding flows** (`flow-user-onboard`, `flow-architect-bootstrap`): Implemented through QUICKSTART.md prompts and examples
- **Testing scenarios** (`test-quickstart-bootstrap`, `test-ai-navigation`): Manual acceptance tests, not automated unit tests

All FDL instructions marked `[ ]` indicate implementation through:
1. Documentation (QUICKSTART.md, README.md, WORKFLOW.md)
2. Agent navigation rules (AGENTS.md, workflows/AGENTS.md)
3. Validator logic (fdd.py)
4. Usage examples (examples/ directory)

This approach is appropriate because the feature defines **how FDD works** rather than implementing a product feature.

### Implementation Notes

**Feature Type**: Core FDD framework (not a product feature) with no dependencies on other FDD features.

### Blocks

This feature blocks implementation of:
- `fdd-fdd-feature-adapter-system` - Requires core AGENTS.md and workflow structure
- `fdd-fdd-feature-workflow-engine` - Requires workflow file specifications
- `fdd-fdd-feature-validation-engine` - Requires structure requirements for validation rules

### Known Limitations

1. **Single project per repository** - Current design assumes one FDD project per Git repository. Multi-project monorepos require manual path management.

2. **Markdown only** - All artifacts must be Markdown. Cannot directly embed interactive diagrams or rich media without external links.

3. **File system dependency** - Requires local file access. Cloud-only environments (browser-based IDEs) need file system abstraction layer.

4. **No workflow versioning** - Workflow files don't have version metadata. Breaking changes to workflows require manual migration.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Workflow DSL** - Structured workflow definition language (YAML/JSON) instead of prose Markdown for better parsing and validation.

2. **Template system** - Reusable workflow and artifact templates with parameterization for common patterns.

3. **Visual workflow designer** - GUI tool for creating workflow files without manual Markdown editing.

4. **Workflow analytics** - Track workflow execution time, success rate, common failure points for continuous improvement.

5. **Multi-language documentation** - Support for internationalization (i18n) of workflow and requirement files.

### Notes

The core methodology framework is intentionally minimal and technology-agnostic. All technology-specific concerns are delegated to the adapter system (feature-adapter-system). This separation ensures FDD remains universally applicable across any tech stack, programming language, or domain model format.
