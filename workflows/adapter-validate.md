## Requirements

**ALWAYS open and follow**: `../requirements/adapter-structure.md`

Extract:
- Two-phase validation (Bootstrap vs Evolved)
- Phase 1: Bootstrap validation criteria (100/100 if Extends)
- Phase 2: Evolved validation criteria (≥80/100)
- Spec file requirements and sources
- Traceability requirements

---

## Prerequisites

**Prerequisites**:
- [ ] Adapter exists - validate: Check {adapter-directory}/AGENTS.md exists

**If adapter missing**: Suggest `adapter-bootstrap` workflow

---

## Steps

### 1. Validate Project Configuration

**Check .fdd-config.json**:
```yaml
File: {project-root}/.fdd-config.json

Required checks:
  1. File exists
  2. Valid JSON format
  3. Contains "fddAdapterPath" field
  4. Path value is non-empty string

If missing or invalid:
  - Report: Configuration file missing or invalid
  - Suggest: Run adapter-bootstrap workflow
  - STOP
```

Store adapter path as: `ADAPTER_REL_PATH`

### 2. Locate Adapter

Use config to locate adapter:
```yaml
ADAPTER_DIR = {project-root}/{ADAPTER_REL_PATH}

Validate:
  - Directory exists
  - Contains AGENTS.md file
  
If not found:
  - Report: Adapter directory not found at configured path
  - STOP
```

Store location as: `ADAPTER_DIR`

### 3. Determine Validation Phase

Check adapter state:

```yaml
Read: {ADAPTER_DIR}/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md

Check for specs directory:
  {ADAPTER_DIR}/FDD-Adapter/specs/

IF specs directory NOT exists OR empty:
  → Phase 1: Bootstrap Validation
ELSE:
  → Phase 2: Evolved Adapter Validation
```

### 4. Execute Phase-Specific Validation

#### Phase 1: Bootstrap Validation (Minimal)

**Check**:
1. Config exists: `{project-root}/.fdd-config.json` (required)
2. Config valid and contains `fddAdapterPath` (required)
3. File exists: `{ADAPTER_DIR}/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md` (required)
4. Contains project name heading (required)
5. Contains `**Extends**: {path}/FDD/AGENTS.md` (required)

**Score**: 100/100 if all 5 checks pass

**Report**: 100/100 
Any check fails: 0/100 

**Pass threshold**: 100/100

### 4. Output Results to Chat

#### Phase 1 Output Format:
```markdown
## Validation: FDD Adapter (Bootstrap)

**Location**: `{ADAPTER_DIR}`  
**Phase**: Bootstrap (Minimal)  
**Score**: {100 or 0}/100  
**Status**: PASS | FAIL  
**Threshold**: 100/100

---

### Checks

✅ | ❌ AGENTS.md exists
✅ | ❌ Project name heading present
✅ | ❌ Extends declaration present

---

### Note

Minimal adapter validated. No specs required yet.
Specs will be added through:
  - Design workflow triggers
  - adapter-auto (project scanning)
  - adapter-manual (manual updates)

---

### Next Steps

**If PASS**: Continue with FDD workflows (prd, design)
**If FAIL**: Fix AGENTS.md structure
```

#### Phase 2 Output Format:
```markdown
## Validation: FDD Adapter (Evolved)

**Location**: `{ADAPTER_DIR}`  
**Phase**: Evolved (With Specs)  
**Score**: {X}/100  
**Status**: PASS | FAIL  
**Threshold**: ≥80/100

### Recommendations

**Critical** (blocking issues):
1. {Fix}

**High Priority**:
1. {Fix}

**Medium Priority**:
1. {Improvement}

---

### Next Steps

**If PASS**: Continue with FDD workflows
**If FAIL**: Fix issues, re-run adapter-validate
```

---

## Validation

Self-validating workflow

---

## Integration

**Called by**:
- `adapter-bootstrap` - After creating minimal AGENTS.md
- `adapter-auto` - After generating specs
- `adapter-manual` - After manual updates
- User explicitly - `adapter-validate` command

**Output**: Always to chat only (no files)

---

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] All workflow steps completed
- [ ] Output artifacts are valid

---


## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All prerequisites were met
- [ ] All steps were executed in order

---


## Next Steps

**If PASS (Phase 1 - Bootstrap)**:
- Continue with FDD workflows
- Adapter will evolve through design/triggers

**If PASS (Phase 2 - Evolved)**:
- Adapter fully validated
- Continue with development workflows

**If FAIL**:
- Fix reported issues
- Re-run `adapter-validate`
