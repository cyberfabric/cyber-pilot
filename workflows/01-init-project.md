# Initialize FDD Project

**Phase**: 1 - Architecture Design  
**Purpose**: Create FDD project structure with Overall Design template

---

## Prerequisites

- Project repository exists
- Write permissions in project directory

---

## Requirements

### 1. Create Directory Structure

**Requirement**: Establish core FDD directory hierarchy

**Required Directories**:
- `architecture/` - Overall Design and feature designs
  - `architecture/features/` - Feature-specific designs
  - `architecture/diagrams/` - Architecture diagrams
- DML specification directory (location per adapter)
- API contract specification directory (location per adapter)

**Expected Outcome**: All required directories exist and are accessible

**Validation Criteria**:
- Directory `architecture/features/` exists
- Directory `architecture/diagrams/` exists
- DML specification directory exists (per adapter)
- API contract specification directory exists (per adapter)

**Note**: Specific directory structure (e.g., `gts/`, `openapi/`) defined by adapter

---

### 2. Initialize Overall Design Document

**Requirement**: Create `architecture/DESIGN.md` with complete section structure

**Required Content**:
- File: `architecture/DESIGN.md`
- **Section A**: Business Context (required)
  - System vision description
  - Core capabilities list
  - Actors and their roles
- **Section B**: Requirements & Principles (required)
  - Use cases and actor interactions
  - Business rules and principles
  - Key constraints
- **Section C**: Technical Architecture (required)
  - Architecture overview and components
  - Domain model specification (DML)
  - API contract specification
  - Security model
  - Non-functional requirements
- **Section D**: Project-Specific Details (optional, not validated)
  - Integration points
  - Future enhancements
  - Project-specific notes
  - Any additional context not covered by A-C

**Template Example**:
```markdown
# Overall Design

## A. Business Context

### System Vision
[Describe what the system does and why it exists]

### Core Capabilities
- Capability 1: [Description]
- Capability 2: [Description]

### Actors
- **Actor Name**: [Role and responsibilities]

## B. Requirements & Principles

### Use Cases
[Actor interactions and use cases]

### Business Rules
[Key business rules and principles]

## C. Technical Architecture

### Architecture Overview
[System components and layers]

### Domain Model
[Link to DML specifications]

### API Contract
[Link to API specifications]

## D. Project-Specific Details (Optional)
[Additional context not covered by A-C]
```

**Expected Outcome**: Complete DESIGN.md template exists

**Validation Criteria**:
- File `architecture/DESIGN.md` exists
- Contains sections A-C (D is optional)
- Each required section has subsections defined
- Placeholders for content present
- No sections H or beyond present

---

### 3. Initialize API Contract Specification

**Requirement**: Create baseline API specification file(s)

**Required Content** (format per adapter):
- API specification file(s) in adapter-defined location
- Valid specification format (e.g., GTS, CTI, OpenAPI 3.0+, GraphQL Schema, gRPC .proto)
- Basic metadata (title, version, description)
- Server/endpoint configuration
- At least one sample endpoint defined (e.g., health check)
- Placeholder for additional endpoints

**Expected Outcome**: Valid API specification exists

**Validation Criteria**:
- API specification file(s) exist in correct location
- Contains valid structure per chosen format
- Has required metadata sections
- At least one endpoint/service defined

---

### 4. Create Features Manifest Placeholder

**Requirement**: Initialize features tracking document

**Required Content**:
- File: `architecture/features/FEATURES.md`
- Module name placeholder
- Status: PLANNING
- Note about running validation workflow first
- Reference to next workflows

**Expected Outcome**: Features manifest placeholder created

**Validation Criteria**:
- File `architecture/features/FEATURES.md` exists
- Contains module name placeholder
- References validation and init-features workflows

---

### 5. Version Control Integration (Optional)

**Requirement**: Add FDD structure to version control system

**Required Actions**:
- Stage all created FDD directories and files
- Commit with descriptive message
- Verify commit successful

**Expected Outcome**: FDD structure under version control

**Validation Criteria**:
- All FDD directories tracked in VCS
- Initial commit exists with FDD structure

---

## Completion Criteria

Project initialization is complete when:

- [ ] All required directories exist and are accessible
- [ ] `architecture/DESIGN.md` exists with all sections A-F structured
- [ ] API contract specification file(s) exist and valid
- [ ] DML specification directory initialized
- [ ] `architecture/features/FEATURES.md` placeholder exists
- [ ] Directory structure follows FDD conventions and adapter requirements
- [ ] All files have appropriate placeholders for content
- [ ] (Optional) FDD structure committed to version control

---

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: Determining Directory Structure

**Resolution**: Follow FDD standard structure as defined above. Consistency across projects enables tooling and understanding.

### Challenge: Existing Conflicting Structure

**Resolution**: If project has existing structure, integrate FDD directories alongside existing ones. FDD doesn't replace project structure, it adds architecture documentation layer.

### Challenge: Unclear Module Boundaries

**Resolution**: Start with broader module definition. Can refine through Overall Design process. Better to start broad and clarify than to start too narrow.

## Next Activities

After project initialization:

1. **Develop Overall Design**: Fill `architecture/DESIGN.md` with actual content
   - Define system vision and core capabilities
   - Identify actors and their use cases
   - Define domain model types
   - Specify API endpoints

2. **Validate Architecture**: Execute validation workflow
   - Ensures structural completeness
   - Checks content adequacy
   - Identifies gaps

3. **Generate Features**: After validation succeeds
   - Analyzes capabilities in Overall Design
   - Creates feature breakdown
   - Establishes dependency graph
