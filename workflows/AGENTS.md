# AI Agent Instructions for FDD Workflows

Instructions for AI assistants on when and which FDD workflow to use.

---

## ⚠️ FIRST STEP: Check for FDD Adapter

**BEFORE selecting any workflow, verify adapter exists**:

1. Look for `{adapter-directory}/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md` that extends `../FDD/AGENTS.md`
2. Common locations:
   - `spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`
   - `guidelines/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`
   - `docs/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`

**If adapter NOT found** → Use **Workflow: adapter-config**

**If adapter found** → Continue with appropriate workflow below

---

## Workflow Selection Guide

Always read the specific workflow file before executing. This guide helps you choose which workflow to use.

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Project Setup

### When: No FDD adapter exists (REQUIRED FIRST)

**adapter-config.md** - Create FDD adapter (greenfield)
- **Use when**: New project, choose formats manually
- **Creates**: Project-specific adapter in `spec/FDD-Adapter/`
- **Next step**: Initialize project (workflow 01)

**adapter-config-from-code.md** - Create FDD adapter (legacy integration)
- **Extends**: `adapter-config.md`
- **Use when**: Existing project, discover formats from code
- **Proposes**: Formats from code analysis instead of asking
- **Next step**: Reverse-engineer project (workflow 01-from-code)

**config-agent-tools.md** - Configure AI agent (optional)
- **Use when**: Want agent to use FDD natively
- **Creates**: Agent config files (`.windsurf/`, `.cursorrules`, etc.)
- **Next step**: Initialize project (workflow 01)

---

## Phase 1: Architecture Design

### When: Starting new FDD project or module

**01-init-project.md** - Initialize FDD structure (greenfield)
- **Use when**: New project, create from scratch
- **Creates**: Directory structure, DESIGN.md template
- **Next step**: User fills templates manually

**01-init-project-from-code.md** - Initialize FDD structure (legacy)
- **Extends**: `01-init-project.md`
- **Use when**: Existing project, reverse-engineer from code
- **Proposes**: Vision/actors/capabilities from code analysis
- **Lowers**: Validation threshold to 70/100
- **Next step**: Validate architecture (workflow 02)

**02-validate-architecture.md** - Validate Overall Design
- **Use when**: `architecture/DESIGN.md` is complete
- **Validates**: Vision, actors, domain model, API contracts, diagrams
- **Required score**: 100/100 + 100% completeness
- **Next step**: Feature planning (workflow 03 or 04)

---

## Phase 2: Feature Planning

### When: Overall Design validated, need to plan features

**03-init-features.md** - Generate features from Overall Design
- **Use when**: Need to extract features from Overall Design automatically
- **Creates**: `FEATURES.md` manifest, feature directories
- **Analyzes**: Overall Design to identify feature list
- **Next step**: Create DESIGN.md for each feature

**04-validate-features.md** - Validate FEATURES.md manifest
- **Use when**: `FEATURES.md` exists and need consistency check
- **Validates**: Manifest completeness, feature list consistency
- **Next step**: Initialize or validate individual features

**05-init-feature.md** - Initialize single feature
- **Use when**: Creating one feature manually (not via 03)
- **Creates**: Feature directory, DESIGN.md template, openspec structure
- **Next step**: User creates Feature Design content

**06-validate-feature.md** - Validate Feature Design
- **Use when**: `architecture/features/feature-{slug}/DESIGN.md` is complete
- **Validates**: Sections A-F, Actor Flows, FDL algorithms, no type redefinitions
- **Required score**: 100/100 + 100% completeness
- **Next step**: OpenSpec initialization (workflow 09)

---

## Phase 3: Feature Implementation

### When: Feature Design validated, ready to implement

**09-openspec-change-next.md** - Create OpenSpec change (first or subsequent)
- **Use when**: Feature Design validated OR previous change completed
- **Creates**: First change after feature validation, or next change after completion
- **Next step**: Implement change (workflow 10)

**10-openspec-change-implement.md** - Implement OpenSpec change
- **Use when**: Active change exists in `openspec/changes/{change-name}/`
- **Implements**: Code according to proposal.md and tasks.md
- **Validates**: Tasks checklist completion
- **Next step**: Code validation (workflow 10-1 - runs automatically)

**10-1-openspec-code-validate.md** - Validate code against spec (AUTOMATIC)
- **Use when**: After workflow 10 completes (runs automatically)
- **Validates**: Code matches spec requirements exactly
- **Blocks**: Workflow 11 if validation fails
- **Next step**: Complete change (workflow 11) if validation passes

**11-openspec-change-complete.md** - Complete OpenSpec change
- **Use when**: Change implementation finished and tested
- **Merges**: Change specs to `openspec/specs/`
- **Archives**: Change to `changes/archive/`
- **Next step**: Create next change (workflow 09) or validate all (workflow 12)

**12-openspec-validate.md** - Validate OpenSpec structure
- **Use when**: Need to verify OpenSpec consistency
- **Validates**: Structure, specs, changes consistency
- **Next step**: Complete feature (workflow 07) if all changes done

**07-complete-feature.md** - Complete feature
- **Use when**: All OpenSpec changes implemented and tested
- **Validates**: Compilation, tests pass, no pending changes
- **Marks**: Feature as complete in `FEATURES.md`
- **Next step**: Next feature or project complete

**08-fix-design.md** - Fix design issues
- **Use when**: Implementation reveals design problem
- **Updates**: DESIGN.md with corrections
- **Re-validates**: Feature Design after fix
- **Next step**: Continue implementation with corrected design

## Common Sequences

**New project from scratch**:
```
adapter-config → 01-init-project → 02-validate-architecture → 03-init-features
→ 06-validate-feature → 09-openspec-change-next → 10-openspec-change-implement
→ 10-1-openspec-code-validate (auto) → 11-openspec-change-complete 
→ 12-openspec-validate → 07-complete-feature
```

**Add single feature to existing project**:
```
05-init-feature → 06-validate-feature → 09-openspec-change-next
→ 10-openspec-change-implement → 10a-openspec-code-validate (auto)
→ 11-openspec-change-complete → 12-openspec-validate → 07-complete-feature
```

**Feature with multiple OpenSpec changes**:
```
09-openspec-change-next → 10-openspec-change-implement → 10a-openspec-code-validate (auto)
→ 11-openspec-change-complete → 09-openspec-change-next 
→ 10-openspec-change-implement → 10a-openspec-code-validate (auto)
→ 11-openspec-change-complete → 12-openspec-validate → 07-complete-feature
```

**Fix design during implementation**:
```
10-openspec-change-implement → [issue found] → 08-fix-design
→ 06-validate-feature → 10-openspec-change-implement (continue)
```

## Critical Rules

- **Always read workflow file before executing** - Don't skip this step
- **Follow workflows sequentially** - Don't jump phases
- **Validate before proceeding** - Use validation workflows at checkpoints
- **One workflow at a time** - Complete current before starting next
- **Re-validate after fixes** - Use workflow 06 after workflow 07
- **OpenSpec commands run from feature root** - ALWAYS run `openspec` commands from `architecture/features/feature-{slug}/` directory (where feature DESIGN.md is located), NEVER from `openspec/` subdirectory

---

## Creating Workflow Extensions

**Purpose**: Extend base workflows with project-specific context modifications.

---

### What Extensions Can Modify

**Any workflow extension can modify**:
- **Context** - Change input source (manual → code analysis, DB → API, etc.)
- **Interactive** - Modify questions (propose answers, skip questions, add questions)
- **Next steps** - Change what runs after (different validation, additional workflows)

**Locations**:
- `FDD/workflows/` - General extensions (e.g., `{base}-from-code.md`)
- `{adapter}/workflows/` - Project-specific extensions

**Examples**:
- `adapter-config-from-code.md` - Changes context (code analysis), proposes answers
- `{adapter}/workflows/02-validate.md` - Adds project commands, changes next steps
- `01-init-project-fast.md` - Skips questions, uses defaults

---

### Requirements for Extensions

**File structure**:
```markdown
# {Workflow Title}

**Extends**: `{base-workflow}.md`
**Purpose**: {What context changes}

---

## AI Agent Instructions

Run `{base-workflow}.md` with these modifications:

### Pre-Workflow
{Bash commands for analysis}

### Modified Questions
**Q1**: {Base question} → {Modification}
{Detection logic in bash}
Propose: {Format}

### Generation Phase
{Output modifications}

---

## Next Workflow
`{next-workflow}.md`
```

**Rules**:
1. ✅ **AI-only content** - No human explanations, only technical instructions
2. ✅ **Bash commands** - Include exact commands for detection/analysis
3. ✅ **Modifications clear** - State exactly what changes vs base workflow
4. ✅ **Next workflow** - Always specify what runs next
5. ❌ **No duplication** - Don't repeat base workflow steps
6. ❌ **No prose** - Skip examples, comparisons, motivation

**Keep under 100 lines** - Extensions should be thin wrappers

---

### Extension Examples

**Context change** (`adapter-config-from-code.md`):
```markdown
**Extends**: `adapter-config.md`
## AI Agent Instructions
Run `adapter-config.md` with these modifications:
### Pre-Workflow
{Bash commands for code scanning}
### Modified Questions
Q1: {Propose from code instead of asking}
```

**Interactive change** (`{adapter}/workflows/01-init.md`):
```markdown
**Extends**: `../../FDD/workflows/01-init-project.md`
## AI Agent Instructions
### Modified Questions
Q2: Skip (use default: "{value}")
Q7: Add new question - "Deployment target?"
```

**Next steps change** (`01-init-fast.md`):
```markdown
**Extends**: `01-init-project.md`
## AI Agent Instructions
### Next Workflow
Skip validation, go directly to `03-init-features.md`
```

---

### Immutable Rules (CANNOT Override)

1. **Workflow sequence** - Phase order fixed
2. **Core questions** - Can propose answers, can't skip questions
3. **Validation thresholds** - Can lower (e.g., 70/100 for legacy), can't disable
4. **File structure** - Can't change what workflow creates
5. **Output format** - Can't change DESIGN.md sections
