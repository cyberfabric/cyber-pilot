# Skills System Specification

**Version**: 1.1  
**Purpose**: Define how agents discover, select, and use Claude-compatible skills in this repository  
**Scope**: All agent work in this repository (all FDD workflows and non-FDD tasks)

**Path base**: All paths in this document are relative to the FDD repository root (the directory containing `AGENTS.md`).

**How to locate the path base in a monorepo**: The FDD repository root is the directory that contains `AGENTS.md` and is the parent directory of `skills/` (this file is `skills/SKILLS.md`).

**Skill root directory**: `skills/`

---

## Core Rules

**MUST**:
- Treat every directory under `skills/` (except this file) as an Agent Skills skill.
- Require each skill directory to contain `SKILL.md` with valid YAML frontmatter.
- Use progressive disclosure:
  - Read only `name` + `description` for discovery.
  - Read SKILL.md body only after selecting a skill.
  - Read `references/` files only when explicitly needed.

**MUST NOT**:
- Load multiple full SKILL bodies into context during discovery.
- Invent skill behavior that is not defined in the skill’s `SKILL.md`.
- Enumerate skills from any other repository root (e.g., monorepo root) instead of the path base defined above.

---

## Toolchain Preflight (MANDATORY)

**Before doing any work that relies on skill scripts, agent MUST verify**:
- `python` OR `python3` is available and runnable

**Minimum checks**:
- `python --version` OR `python3 --version`

**If ANY tool is missing**:
- STOP.
- Do NOT proceed with the workflow/task.
- Propose an installation approach.
- The agent chooses how to install (method is not prescribed here).
- The user must approve any commands that modify the system.

---

## Adding a New Skill (Repository Policy)

A new skill directory under `skills/` MUST:
- Contain `SKILL.md`
- Use a `name` that matches the directory name
- Keep SKILL.md body concise and use `references/` for detailed material

If a skill contains `scripts/`, it MUST:
- Contain `tests/` with unit tests for the scripts
- Use Python standard library `unittest` (no external test dependencies)
- Be deterministic (no network access, no time-based assertions, no random data)
- Avoid modifying repository state (use temporary files/directories for test artifacts)
- Cover both PASS and FAIL cases for every supported artifact kind/branch in the script

To run tests:
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s /FDD/skills/<skill>/tests -p 'test_*.py'`

## Available Skills

### fdd

**Name**: `fdd`  
**Description**: Unified FDD tool for artifact validation, search, and traceability. Validates FDD artifacts (PRD.md, DESIGN.md, architecture/ADR/ directory, FEATURES.md, feature DESIGN.md) against structure requirements, provides search and ID lookup across artifacts, and enables full bidirectional traceability between documentation and code.

**Primary capabilities**:
- Artifact validation with deterministic pass/fail
- Search and query FDD artifacts
- ID extraction and lookup (actors, capabilities, requirements, flows, etc.)
- Repository-wide traceability (where-defined, where-used)
- Code traceability scanning (@fdd-* tags)
- Support for qualified IDs (:ph-N:inst-*)

**Location**: `skills/fdd/`  
**See**: `skills/fdd/SKILL.md` for complete documentation
