# Architecture Decision Record Review Prompt

Review the following PR changes against ADR best practices.

Focus on:
- Ensure this problem is module/system scoped, not generic and repeatable
- Compliance with /docs/spec-templates/ADR.md template
- Ensure this problem is not already solved by other existing ADRs in docs/adrs/
- Alternatives are genuinely different approaches (not straw men)
- Decision rationale is concrete and traceable to project constraints

Use `docs/checklists/ADR.md` as the structured review guide.
Pay attention to the "PR Review Focus (ADR)" section at the end of the checklist.
