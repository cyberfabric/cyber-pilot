# .gen — Generated Files

**Do NOT edit files in this directory.**

These files are auto-generated by Cypilot from kit blueprints during
`cpt init`, `cpt kit install`, or `cpt generate-resources`.

Contents:

- `SKILL.md` — aggregated skill navigation (routes to per-kit skills)
- `AGENTS.md` — generated agent navigation rules
- `kits/{slug}/SKILL.md` — per-kit skill instructions from `@cpt:skill` blocks
- `kits/{slug}/artifacts/{KIND}/` — generated templates, rules, checklists, examples
- `kits/{slug}/constraints.toml` — structural constraints from `@cpt:heading`/`@cpt:id`

Source of truth: blueprints in `config/kits/{slug}/blueprints/`.
To regenerate: `cpt generate-resources`.
Any manual changes **will be overwritten** on the next generation.
