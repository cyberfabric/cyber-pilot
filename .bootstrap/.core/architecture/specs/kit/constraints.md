## Overview

`constraints.toml` is a **generated** kit-wide output file produced by the Blueprint Processor from `@cpt:heading` and `@cpt:id` markers across all artifact blueprints. It defines structural validation rules:

- Document outline constraints (heading patterns, levels, ordering)
- ID definition and reference validation rules
- Cross-artifact reference coverage rules

**Key properties**:
- Generated from all artifact blueprints in a kit — do not edit manually
- Kit-wide: one file per kit, aggregated from all artifact blueprints
- Per-artifact constraints are grouped under `[artifacts.<KIND>]`
- Used by the Validator for deterministic structural checks
- Regenerated by `cypilot generate-resources`

---

## Location

**Kit-wide**: `{cypilot_path}/config/kits/<slug>/constraints.toml`

---

## Source Markers

| Marker | Role |
|--------|------|
| `@cpt:heading` | Heading constraint definition → `[[artifacts.<KIND>.headings]]` |
| `@cpt:id` | ID kind definition with cross-artifact reference rules → `[artifacts.<KIND>.identifiers]` |

Constraints are generated only from blueprints that have an `artifact` key in `@cpt:blueprint`. Codebase blueprints (without `artifact` key) do not contribute to constraints.toml.

See [blueprint.md spec](blueprint.md) for full marker reference.

---

## Generation Algorithm

1. For each installed blueprint with an `artifact` key:
   a. Collect all `@cpt:heading` TOML blocks → `[[artifacts.<KIND>.headings]]` entries.
   b. Collect all `@cpt:id` TOML blocks → `[artifacts.<KIND>.identifiers.<kind>]` entries with `[ref.<TARGET>]` sub-tables.
2. Aggregate all artifact constraints into one file keyed by `[artifacts.<KIND>]`.
3. Serialize as TOML with deterministic key ordering.

**Determinism guarantee**: same blueprints → identical `constraints.toml` (byte-for-byte).

## File Format

### Root Structure

```toml
# Auto-generated from all kit blueprints — do not edit manually
kit = "sdlc"

# Per-artifact constraints are grouped under [artifacts.<KIND>]

# Heading constraints (from @cpt:heading markers)
[[artifacts.PRD.headings]]
id = "prd-h1-title"
level = 1
required = true
pattern = "PRD\\s*[—–-]\\s*.+"

[[artifacts.PRD.headings]]
id = "prd-overview"
level = 2
required = true
numbered = true
pattern = "Overview"

# ID kind constraints (from @cpt:id markers)
[artifacts.PRD.identifiers.fr]
name = "Functional Requirement"
required = true
task = true
priority = true
to_code = true

[artifacts.PRD.identifiers.fr.ref.DESIGN]
coverage = true

[artifacts.PRD.identifiers.fr.ref.DECOMPOSITION]
# coverage omitted = optional

# Another artifact kind in the same file
[[artifacts.DESIGN.headings]]
id = "design-h1-title"
level = 1
required = true
pattern = "DESIGN\\s*[—–-]\\s*.+"
```

### Heading Constraints

Each `[[artifacts.<KIND>.headings]]` entry defines a constraint for one heading position in the artifact outline. Generated from `@cpt:heading` TOML blocks in the blueprint.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | string | — | Stable identifier (from `@cpt:heading.id`) |
| `level` | integer 1–6 | — | Required heading level |
| `required` | boolean | `true` | Whether this heading must be present |
| `multiple` | boolean or omit | omit | `true` = required multiple, `false` = prohibited, omit = allowed |
| `numbered` | boolean or omit | omit | `true` = required, `false` = prohibited, omit = allowed |
| `pattern` | string (regex) | — | Applied to heading title text (excluding `#` markers and numbering prefix) |
| `description` | string | — | Human-readable description of section intent |

**Boolean convention** (aligned with blueprint): `true` = required, `false` = prohibited, omit = optional/allowed.

### ID Constraints

Each `[artifacts.<KIND>.identifiers.<kind>]` table defines validation rules for one ID kind. Generated from `@cpt:id` TOML blocks in the blueprint.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | — | Human-readable name |
| `description` | string | — | Description of the ID kind |
| `required` | boolean | `true` | Whether at least one ID of this kind must be defined |
| `task` | boolean or omit | omit | `true` = task checkbox required, `false` = prohibited, omit = allowed |
| `priority` | boolean or omit | omit | `true` = priority marker required, `false` = prohibited, omit = allowed |
| `to_code` | boolean | `false` | Whether this ID kind must be traceable to code |
| `headings` | array of strings | — | Heading constraint IDs where this ID kind must be defined |

### Reference Rules

Each `[artifacts.<KIND>.identifiers.<kind>.ref.<TARGET>]` sub-table defines cross-artifact reference rules. Generated from `[ref.ARTIFACT]` sub-tables in `@cpt:id` TOML blocks.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `coverage` | boolean or omit | omit | `true` = required, `false` = prohibited, omit = optional |
| `task` | boolean or omit | omit | `true` = task on reference required, `false` = prohibited, omit = allowed |
| `priority` | boolean or omit | omit | `true` = priority on reference required, `false` = prohibited, omit = allowed |
| `headings` | array of strings | — | Heading constraint IDs where references must appear in the target artifact |

**Boolean convention**: same as everywhere — `true` = required, `false` = prohibited, omit = optional/allowed.

## Validation Semantics

### Heading Validation

The validator walks the artifact's Markdown headings and checks against `[[artifacts.<KIND>.headings]]` entries in `constraints.toml`:

**Matching rules**:
- Heading `level` is derived from leading `#` count
- Heading `raw title` is the text after `# ` prefix
- If numbered, the prefix is parsed as `^<num>(\.<num>)*\s+` and stripped before pattern matching
- A constraint matches when `level` matches AND `pattern` matches the stripped title text

**Ordering rules**:
- Constrained headings MUST appear in the order declared in `[[headings]]`
- Between two constrained headings `H_i` and `H_{i+1}`: deeper-level headings are allowed freely unless they are constrained elsewhere
- Same-or-higher-level headings that don't match `H_{i+1}` are a mixing error

**Presence and repetition**:
- `required = true` (default): heading must exist
- `multiple = false`: at most one match allowed
- `multiple = true`: at least two matches required
- `multiple` omitted: any number allowed

**Numbering**:
- `numbered = true`: each matching heading MUST have a numbering prefix
- `numbered = false`: MUST NOT have a numbering prefix
- Numbering progression: consecutive numbered headings at the same level must increment by 1; nested numbering must be consistent with parent prefix

### ID Validation

For each `[artifacts.<KIND>.identifiers.<kind>]` in `constraints.toml`:

- **`required = true`**: at least one ID definition of this kind must exist; validation FAILS if none found
- **`task = true`**: definition line MUST have a checkbox (`[ ]` / `[x]`); `task = false`: MUST NOT
- **`priority = true`**: definition line MUST have a priority token (`` `p1` ``); `priority = false`: MUST NOT
- **`to_code = true`**: ID must be traceable to code (see traceability spec)
  - If definition has a checked checkbox (`[x]`): code marker required
  - If definition has an unchecked checkbox (`[ ]`): code marker prohibited
  - If no checkbox: code marker required
- **`headings`**: ID definitions MUST appear within a section whose active heading constraint ID is in the list

### Cross-Artifact Validation

Cross-artifact validation builds an index of all ID definitions and references across registered artifacts, then enforces `[identifiers.<kind>.ref.<TARGET>]` rules:

**Coverage rules** (per ID definition `d` of kind `K` in artifact kind `A`, for each `ref.T` rule):

| `coverage` | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `true` (required) | At least one reference to `d` must exist in an artifact of kind `T`. If no `T` artifacts exist for the system → warning. |
| `false` (prohibited) | No references to `d` may exist in artifacts of kind `T`. |
| omitted (optional) | No requirement. |

**Reference task/priority rules**: when a reference exists, its line is checked for task/priority markers per the `ref.T.task` and `ref.T.priority` settings.

**Checkbox synchronization**: if a reference is marked done (`[x]`) and both the reference and definition track task status, the definition MUST also be marked done.

**System scoping**: IDs are scoped to systems. System prefixes are derived from the system tree in `artifacts.toml` using slug hierarchy. Matching is longest-prefix-wins.

---

## Artifact Scanning

Cypilot extracts IDs, references, and CDSL instructions from artifacts using best-effort scanning.

**ID definitions** — recognized via human-facing formats:
```markdown
- [ ] **ID**: `cpt-my-system-fr-login`
- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-my-system-flow-login`
```

Scanner emits: `type: definition`, `id`, `line`, `checked: true|false`, `priority: pN`

**ID references** — recognized in two ways:
- Standalone backticked IDs on list lines: `` - `cpt-my-system-fr-login` ``
- Any inline backticked occurrence: `` ...`cpt-my-system-fr-login`... ``

Scanner emits: `type: reference`, `id`, `line`

**CDSL instructions** — lines matching CDSL step format (see CDSL spec)

Scanner emits: `type: cdsl_instruction`, `phase`, `inst`, `line`, `parent_id` (nearest preceding ID definition)

**Code fence exclusion**: all scanning MUST ignore content inside fenced code blocks.

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `CONSTRAINTS_HEADING_ORDER` | Constrained headings appear out of order in artifact | Reorder sections to match constraint order |
| `CONSTRAINTS_HEADING_MISSING` | Required heading not found in artifact | Add the required section |
| `CONSTRAINTS_HEADING_DUPLICATE` | `multiple = false` but heading matched more than once | Remove duplicate sections |
| `CONSTRAINTS_HEADING_NOT_NUMBERED` | `numbered = true` but heading lacks numbering prefix | Add numbering prefix |
| `CONSTRAINTS_ID_MISSING` | `required = true` but no IDs of this kind found | Add at least one ID definition |
| `CONSTRAINTS_ID_NO_TASK` | `task = true` but ID definition has no checkbox | Add checkbox `[ ]` or `[x]` to definition |
| `CONSTRAINTS_ID_NO_PRIORITY` | `priority = true` but ID definition has no priority token | Add priority marker (e.g., `` `p1` ``) |
| `CONSTRAINTS_ID_WRONG_HEADING` | ID defined outside allowed heading sections | Move ID to a section under an allowed heading |
| `CONSTRAINTS_COVERAGE_MISSING` | `coverage = true` but no reference found in target artifact kind | Add reference in target artifact |
| `CONSTRAINTS_COVERAGE_PROHIBITED` | `coverage = false` but references found in target artifact kind | Remove references from target artifact |
| `CONSTRAINTS_CHECKBOX_SYNC` | Reference marked done but definition not marked done | Mark definition as done or unmark reference |
