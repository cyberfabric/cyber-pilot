# FDD Adapter Creation Guide

## Core Principle

Adapters extend FDD with project-specific context. Start files with `Extends: ../FDD/path/to/file.md`.

**You can override/add anything EXCEPT the immutable rules below.**

---

## Immutable Rules (NEVER Override)

These are validated by tooling and cannot be changed:

### 1. Design Hierarchy
```
ADAPTER → BUSINESS CONTEXT → OVERALL DESIGN → FEATURE DESIGN → CHANGES → CODE
```
Must reference parent level, never contradict.

- **ADAPTER**: Defines tech stack, formats, conventions (first step, required)
- **BUSINESS CONTEXT**: Defines actors, capabilities, business requirements
- **OVERALL DESIGN**: Architecture, domain model, API contracts
- **FEATURE DESIGN**: Actor flows, algorithms, requirements
- **CHANGES**: Atomic implementation plan with tasks
- **CODE**: Implementation following CHANGES

### 2. Mandatory FDD Rules
- Actor Flows (Section B) are PRIMARY - always start from what actors do
- Use FDL for flows/algorithms/states - NEVER code in DESIGN.md
- Never redefine types - reference domain model from Overall Design
- Validate before proceeding (Overall ≥90/100, Feature 100/100)
- Feature size limits: ≤3000 lines (recommended), ≤4000 (hard limit)
- Implementation changes are atomic - one change = one deployable unit
- Design is source of truth - if code contradicts design, fix design first

### 3. File Structure
```
architecture/
├── DESIGN.md                    # Overall Design
└── features/
    ├── FEATURES.md              # Feature manifest
    └── feature-{slug}/
        ├── DESIGN.md            # Feature Design
        └── CHANGES.md           # Implementation plan
```

### 4. DESIGN.md Sections
**Overall Design**:
- Section A: Business Context
- Section B: Requirements & Principles
- Section C: Technical Architecture
- Section D: Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - REQUIRED, MADR format
- Section E: Project-Specific Details (optional)

**Feature Design**:
- Section A: Feature Overview
- Section B: Actor Flows (PRIMARY)
- Section C: Algorithms
- Section D: States (optional)
- Section E: Technical Details
- Section F: Requirements (formalized scope + Testing Scenarios in FDL)
- Section G: Implementation Plan (implementation changes with status)

### 5. Validation Scores
- Overall Design: ≥90/100
- Feature Design: 100/100 + 100% completeness

## What Adapters Define

Everything else is adapter-specific. Define as needed:

**Note**: All FDD operation workflows now support **CREATE and UPDATE modes**. Adapters can be created once and updated anytime as project evolves. Use `adapter.md` workflow to create or update your adapter.

### Tech Stack (`specs/tech-stack.md`)
- Primary language and version
- Frameworks (backend, frontend)
- Database type and version
- Additional services (cache, message queue, search)
- Development tools (package manager, build tool, linter, formatter)

### Domain Model Format (`specs/domain-model.md`)
- Technology (TypeScript, JSON Schema, Protobuf, GTS, etc.)
- Location (`architecture/domain-model/`, per-feature, etc.)
- DML syntax (`@DomainModel.TypeName` for clickable references)
- Validation commands
- Naming conventions
- Traceability requirements (clickable links from Feature→Overall)

### API Contract Format (`specs/api-contracts.md`)
- Technology (OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC, CLISPEC, etc.)
- Location (`architecture/api-specs/`, `architecture/cli-specs/`, etc.)
- Linking syntax (`@API.GET:/path`, `@CLI.command-name`, `@Feature.{slug}` for clickable references)
- Validation commands
- API conventions
- Traceability requirements (clickable links from Feature→Overall)

**Note**: For CLI tools, consider using **CLISPEC** - a built-in, simple format for CLI command documentation. See `CLISPEC.md` for specification.

### Patterns & Architecture (`specs/patterns.md`)
- Architecture style (layered, hexagonal, microservices, etc.)
- Core design patterns (DI, repository, error handling, etc.)
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Module organization guidelines

### Code Conventions (`specs/conventions.md`)
- Naming conventions (files, directories, variables, functions, classes)
- Code style (indentation, line length, braces, imports)
- Documentation requirements
- Error handling patterns

### Testing Strategy (`specs/testing.md`)
- Test frameworks (unit, integration, E2E)
- Test organization and structure
- Coverage requirements
- Mocking strategy
- Test commands

### Build & Deployment (`specs/build-deploy.md`)
- Build tool and commands
- Development environment setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Deployment strategy and environments
- Database migrations

### Linting (`specs/linting.md`)
- Linter configuration
- Formatting tools
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI integration
- Custom lint rules

### Security (`specs/security.md`)
- Authentication and authorization strategy
- Input validation requirements
- Data protection (encryption, sensitive data handling)
- API security (rate limiting, CORS, headers)
- Secrets management
- Security testing

### Performance (`specs/performance.md`)
- Performance requirements and SLAs
- Benchmarking strategy and tools
- Profiling guidelines
- Optimization best practices
- Caching strategies
- Resource usage limits

### Project Structure (`specs/project-structure.md`)
- Directory organization
- File naming conventions
- FDD artifact locations
- Source code structure
- Test and documentation locations

### Additional Specs (as needed)
- `rest-api-guidelines.md` - REST API conventions
- `graphql-guidelines.md` - GraphQL schema patterns
- `architectural-lints.md` - Custom architectural rules
- `module-creation.md` - Module creation templates
- Language-specific guidelines (e.g., `rust-guidelines.md`, `typescript-guidelines.md`)

**Required in all spec files**:
- **Validation checklist**: Agent self-verification criteria
- **Examples**: Valid ✅ and invalid ❌ examples
- **Commands**: Concrete, cross-platform verification commands

**Validation output format**: MUST be chat output only, NO report files

### Behavior Description Language (Optional Override)
- **Default**: FDL (Flow Description Language) for flows/algorithms/states
- **Can override**: Create custom behavior specification in `{adapter-directory}/`
- **Example**: Replace `../FDL.md` with `../FDD-Adapter/CustomBDL.md`
- **Requirements**: Define control flow keywords, syntax rules, validation criteria
- **Note**: Must update workflows 05 and 06 to reference custom spec

### Additional Artifacts
- Diagrams location and format
- Documentation structure
- CI/CD configuration
- Any project-specific tooling

## Adapter Structure

```bash
{project-root}/
├── FDD-Adapter/                 # Your project-specific extensions (at root level)

│   └── specs/                   # Detailed specifications
│       ├── tech-stack.md        # Languages, frameworks, databases, versions
│       ├── domain-model.md      # Domain model format and location
│       ├── api-contracts.md     # API contract format and location
│       ├── patterns.md          # Architecture patterns and design principles
│       ├── conventions.md       # Coding standards and naming rules
│       ├── testing.md           # Testing frameworks and commands

└── FDD/                         # Core FDD (as git submodule or direct copy)
```

**Important**: FDD-Adapter MUST be at project root level, discoverable from `{project-root}/FDD-Adapter/`

**Alternative locations** (if needed):
- `{project-root}/guidelines/FDD-Adapter/`
- `{project-root}/spec/FDD-Adapter/`
- `{project-root}/docs/FDD-Adapter/`

**Avoid**: Deep nesting like `{project-root}/guidelines/subfolder/FDD-Adapter/` ❌

**Common spec files** (create as needed):
- **Core**: tech-stack, domain-model, api-contracts, conventions, testing, build-deploy
- **Quality**: linting, security, performance, architectural-lints
- **Structure**: project-structure, patterns, module-creation
- **API-specific**: rest-api-guidelines, graphql-guidelines, cli-spec
