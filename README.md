## Cyber Pilot — Agentic Kit with AI-Native SDLC Automation

Cyber Pilot keeps **requirements, design, code, and tests continuously aligned** in repositories that use AI-assisted development.

AI can generate artifacts fast. Cyber Pilot makes sure they stay **consistent and traceable over time**.

## Problem

In most projects:

- Requirements, design and code evolve separately  
- Documentation becomes outdated  
- AI-generated changes introduce silent scope drift  
- There is no automated ownership of end-to-end consistency  

The result is slower onboarding, risky refactoring, misleading documentation and unclear decision history.

## What Cyber Pilot adds

A lightweight automation layer for repository-native governance:

- Structured spec templates (BRD, PRD, ADR, DESIGN, etc.)
- Human-readable traceability IDs linking specs ↔ code ↔ tests
- CLI checks for cross-document and code consistency
- AI workflows for generation, review and validation
- CI-friendly validation with a single script

Works with any language, stack, or repository.

## Prerequisites

Before using **Cypilot**, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8+** — Required for `cypilot` tool execution
- **Git** — For version control and submodule installation (recommended)
- **AI Agent** — OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Windsurf, Cursor, GH Copilot, or similar LLM-powered coding assistant integrated with your IDE

---

## Project Setup (Cypilot + Agents)

Add Cypilot to your repo, then initialize and generate agent proxy files.

```bash
# Option A: git submodule (recommended)
git submodule add https://github.com/cyberfabric/cyber-pilot cypilot
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Option B: plain clone
git clone https://github.com/cyberfabric/cyber-pilot cypilot
```

```bash
# Agent-safe invocation (recommended)
python3 cypilot/skills/cypilot/scripts/cypilot.py init
python3 cypilot/skills/cypilot/scripts/cypilot.py agents --agent windsurf
```

Supported agents: `windsurf`, `cursor`, `claude`, `copilot`, `openai`.

If you update the Cypilot submodule later, re-run:

```bash
python3 cypilot/skills/cypilot/scripts/cypilot.py agents --agent windsurf
```

## Using Cypilot

To use Cypilot, run your IDE with an AI agent (or run an agent in a terminal), and then start your requests with `cypilot`.

That prefix switches the agent into Cypilot mode: it loads the adapter + required rules, routes the request to the right workflow (analyze vs generate), and gates any file writes behind explicit confirmation.

### Real Conversation (Prompt Excerpt)

Below are a few real prompts from the story (with outcomes summarized). The full conversation is in [`guides/STORY.md`](guides/STORY.md).

#### 1) Enable Cypilot mode

Prompt: `cypilot on`

**Summary:** The user enables Cypilot mode. The agent runs Protocol Guard, loads required context files, and confirms the rules it will follow before proceeding.

<details>
  <summary>Expand chat details...</summary>

**USER**

`cypilot on`

**ASSISTANT**

_Thought for 2s_

#### Enabling Cypilot mode

You've explicitly turned **Cypilot mode on**.

Next I'll:

- Confirm I understand the Cypilot MUST rules
- Read the required Cypilot control files (`skills/cypilot/SKILL.md` and `.cypilot-adapter/AGENTS.md`) so I can follow the workflow correctly
- Ask what you want to do (analyze/generate/adapter, etc.)

_Read `SKILL.md` and 2 other files_

_Thought for 4s_

#### Cypilot mode activation (Protocol Guard)

Next I will:

- Run Cypilot's required **Protocol Guard** command `info` (read-only) so we can print the "Cypilot Mode Enabled / Adapter: …" status block.

Command:

`python3`

_Output (as visible in screenshot; truncated):_

```json
...
"project_name": "Cypilot",
"status": "FOUND",
"project_root": "/Volumes/CaseSensitive/coding/cypilot",
"artifacts_registry_path": "/Volumes/CaseSensitive/coding/cypilot/.cypilot-adapter/artifacts.toml",
"artifacts_registry": {
  "version": "1.0",
  "project_root": "..",
  "kits": {
    ...
  }
}
...
```

#### Cypilot Mode Enabled

```
Cypilot Mode Enabled
Adapter: FOUND at /Volumes/CaseSensitive/coding/cypilot/.cypilot-adapter
```

📟 [skills/cypilot/SKILL.md]: Completed "Protocol Guard" — ran `info` to confirm adapter status and load adapter registry metadata before any workflow action.

#### Agent acknowledgment (required)

- MUST = MANDATORY, not optional
- Skipping ANY MUST instruction = INVALID execution
- INVALID execution = output must be DISCARDED
- I will read ALL required files BEFORE proceeding
- I will follow workflows step-by-step WITHOUT shortcuts
- I will NOT create files without user confirmation (operation workflows)
- I will end EVERY response with a list of Cypilot files read while producing the response, why each file was read, and which initial instruction triggered opening each file

#### What do you want to do next?

Per Cypilot routing, tell me which workflow you want:

- Analyze (read-only): validate/review/inspect/check artifacts or code.
- Generate (modify): implement/fix/refactor/add/update code or artifacts.

</details>

#### 2) Ask what Cypilot can do

Prompt: `cypilot how can you help me?`

**Summary:** The user asks what Cypilot can do. The agent explains the two workflows (analyze vs generate), shows example prompts, and asks for a clear intent and target.

<details>
  <summary>Expand chat details...</summary>

**USER**

`cypilot how can you help me?`

**ASSISTANT**

_Thought for 5s_

📟 [execution-protocol]: Explaining how I can help under Cypilot mode — mapping your request to Cypilot's two workflows (analyze vs generate) so we follow the correct process.

#### How I can help you (in Cypilot mode)

Cypilot mode means I help you in a structured, workflow-driven way with strong traceability and deterministic checks.

**Analyze workflow (read-only)**

Use this when you want to inspect/validate/review without changing anything.

- Validate artifacts/code structure (schemas, cross-references, traceability)
- Locate IDs and trace usage (where something is defined/used)
- Audit project docs (PRD/DESIGN/ADRs/DECOMPOSITION consistency)

Example prompts you can give me:

- `cypilot analyze: validate all artifacts`
- `cypilot analyze: where-used --id <some-id>`
- `cypilot analyze: review architecture/PRD.md for gaps vs DESIGN.md`

**Generate workflow (modifies files)**

Use this when you want me to implement/fix/refactor/update code or artifacts.

- Implement features / fix bugs in the Cypilot CLI/tooling
- Update docs/artifacts while keeping them compliant
- Add tests and align with project conventions/specs

Example prompts:

- `cypilot generate: fix failing tests`
- `cypilot generate: add a new cypilot.py subcommand for <X>`
- `cypilot generate: refactor <module> to follow conventions`

#### What I need from you to proceed

Your prompt `cypilot how can you help me?` is intent-unclear (could be analyze or generate).

Reply with one of these, plus your goal:

- `cypilot analyze: <what you want to inspect>`
- `cypilot generate: <what you want to change/build>`

#### Status

- Completed: Explained Cypilot-mode capabilities and how to choose the correct workflow.
- Pending: You choose analyze (read-only) or generate (modify) + what target (artifact/code).

</details>

#### 3) Ask what Cypilot can generate

Prompt: `cypilot what can I generate with you?`

**Summary:** The user asks what "generate" can do. The agent lists supported write outcomes (adapter, architecture artifacts, code), what it will not do blindly, and provides copy/paste examples.

<details>
  <summary>Expand chat details...</summary>

**USER**

`cypilot what can I generate with you?`

**ASSISTANT**

_Thought for 18s_

📟 [execution-protocol]: I'm going to re-open `guides/ADAPTER.md` so I can accurately describe what kinds of "generate" actions are supported and what constraints apply, then I'll give you a concrete list of things you can generate and the exact prompts to use.

_Read `ADAPTER.md`_

📟 [execution-protocol]: Entering "Generate capabilities" — I'm mapping "what can I generate?" to Cypilot's supported WRITE outcomes (adapter, artifacts, codebase) and the immutable adapter rules you must not violate.

#### What you can generate with me (Cypilot generate workflow)

1) **Adapter (project context)**

- [Create/update `.cypilot-adapter/`]: `AGENTS.md` + spec files that define your tech stack, conventions, testing strategy, build/deploy, project structure, patterns, etc.
- [Add new adapter specs]: e.g. `security.md`, `performance.md`, `linting.md`, custom API guidelines, module-creation rules.

2) **Architecture artifacts (design → feature → implementation plan)**

- [PRD]: create/update `architecture/PRD.md` (actors, capabilities, requirements).
- [Overall DESIGN]: create/update `architecture/DESIGN.md` (requirements/principles, architecture, ADR index, etc.).
- [ADRs]: create new ADRs in `architecture/ADR/...` in the required format.
- [DECOMPOSITION]: update `architecture/DECOMPOSITION.md` to reflect feature breakdown and traceability.
- [FEATURE docs]: create/update feature documents under `architecture/features/...` (e.g. "template system"-style features).

3) **Codebase changes (implementation)**

- [Implement/fix/refactor code]: especially the Cypilot CLI (`skills/cypilot/scripts/cypilot.py`) and related modules.
- [Add new CLI subcommands]: plus CLISPEC/docs updates if needed.
- [Add tests]: unit/integration tests aligned to the adapter's testing spec.
- [Build/CI tweaks]: updates to tooling/config consistent with build-deploy spec.

#### What "generate" will not do blindly

- [No surprise file creation]: I will ask for confirmation before creating new files (mandatory rule).
- [No breaking hierarchy]: We won't violate the design chain:

  `ADAPTER → PRD → OVERALL DESIGN → FEATURE → CODE`

- [No coding in DESIGN.md]: Actor flows / algorithms should be in Cypilot Domain-Specific Language (CDSL) where required, not embedded code.
- [Validation-first mindset]: We'll aim for the required scores (Overall ≥90/100, Feature 100/100) before "locking in" implementation direction.

#### How to ask (examples you can copy/paste)

- Adapter work

  `cypilot generate: create/update adapter specs for a new TypeScript + Next.js app`

- New feature from idea → design → code

  `cypilot generate: add a new feature "<feature>" — update PRD + DESIGN + spec, then implement`

  `cypilot generate: add a new feature "<feature>" — update PRD + DESIGN + FEATURE, then implement`

- Code-first change

  `cypilot generate: add a new cypilot.py subcommand "<name>" that does <behavior>`

- Quality work

  `cypilot generate: refactor <module> to match conventions + add tests`

#### One question so I can start the right "generate" path

What do you want to generate right now?

- [Adapter] (project rules/specs)
- [Artifacts] (PRD/DESIGN/ADR/specs)
- [Code] (implementation/tests)

Reply with: `cypilot generate: <your goal>` + which of the three targets.

</details>

**End result of the full story:** A working example application ("Overwork Alert") with CLI + daemon wiring, deterministic validations, unit tests, and a successful manual macOS smoke test.

### Agent Skill

Cypilot provides a single **Agent Skill** (`cypilot`) following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). The skill is defined in `skills/cypilot/SKILL.md` and gets loaded into the agent's context when invoked.

The skill provides:
- Artifact validation and search capabilities
- ID lookup and traceability across documents and code
- Protocol guard for consistent context loading
- Integration with project adapter

When the skill is loaded, the agent gains access to Cypilot's CLI commands and workflow triggers.

### Workflow Commands

For agents that don't support the Agent Skills specification, Cypilot provides **workflow commands** — slash commands that load structured prompts guiding the agent through deterministic pipelines:

| Command | Workflow | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `/cypilot` | — | Enable Cypilot mode, discover adapter, show available workflows |
| `/cypilot-generate` | `workflows/generate.md` | Create/update artifacts (PRD, DESIGN, DECOMPOSITION, ADR, FEATURE) or implement code with traceability markers |
| `/cypilot-analyze` | `workflows/analyze.md` | Validate artifacts against templates or code against design (deterministic + semantic) |
| `/cypilot-adapter` | `workflows/adapter.md` | Create/update project adapter — scan structure, configure rules, generate `AGENTS.md` and `artifacts.toml` |

Each workflow includes feedback loops, quality gates, and references to relevant checklists and rules.

### Checklists and Quality Gates

Cypilot provides **expert-level checklists** for validation at each stage.

**Artifact checklists** in `kits/sdlc/artifacts/{KIND}/`:
- [**PRD checklist**](kits/sdlc/artifacts/PRD/checklist.md) — 300+ criteria for requirements completeness, stakeholder coverage, constraint clarity
- [**DESIGN checklist**](kits/sdlc/artifacts/DESIGN/checklist.md) — 380+ criteria for architecture validation, component boundaries, integration points
- [**DECOMPOSITION checklist**](kits/sdlc/artifacts/DECOMPOSITION/checklist.md) — 130+ criteria for feature breakdown quality, dependency mapping
- [**FEATURE checklist**](kits/sdlc/artifacts/FEATURE/checklist.md) — 380+ criteria for implementation readiness, acceptance criteria, edge cases
- [**ADR checklist**](kits/sdlc/artifacts/ADR/checklist.md) — 270+ criteria for decision rationale, alternatives analysis, consequences

**Generic checklists** in `requirements/`:
- [**Code checklist**](requirements/code-checklist.md) — 200+ criteria for code quality, security, error handling, testing
- [**Consistency checklist**](requirements/consistency-checklist.md) — 45+ criteria for cross-artifact consistency and contradiction detection
- [**Reverse engineering**](requirements/reverse-engineering.md) — 270+ criteria for legacy code analysis methodology
- [**Prompt engineering**](requirements/prompt-engineering.md) — 220+ criteria for AI prompt design guidelines

Use checklists by referencing them in `/cypilot-analyze` or manually during review.

## Extensibility

Cypilot is extensible: there can be multiple agent packages called **Kits**. A Kit bundles templates, rules, checklists, and examples for a specific domain or use case.

Cypilot ships with a built-in **SDLC Kit** that runs a full PRD → code pipeline, with traceability and validation at every step.

### Kit: **Cypilot SDLC**

**Cypilot SDLC** is a production-ready software development life cycle (SDLC) SDD built on **Cypilot**. It fully leverages Cypilot’s capabilities — identifier-based **traceability**, reliable **workflows** that follow a strict protocol, and Kit-defined rules and tasks, structured templates and quality checklists. Each Kit can both generate (transform/derive) content and evaluate it: scoring semantic quality, validating artifact-to-artifact alignment (e.g., requirements → design → implementation), and enforcing structure against the templates defined in the kit.

See the [SDLC Pipeline](kits/sdlc/README.md) for a detailed overview of the **Cypilot SDLC** pipeline, artifact kinds, generation and validation processes, and references to related documentation.
