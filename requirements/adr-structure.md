## Best Practices

### Writing ADRs

1. **Write ADRs when**:
   - Making significant architectural decisions
   - Choosing between multiple viable options
   - Establishing architectural constraints
   - Changing existing architecture
   - Making trade-offs between quality attributes

2. **Do NOT write ADRs for**:
   - Obvious or trivial decisions
   - Decisions that can be easily reversed
   - Implementation details
   - Coding standards or style choices

### Decision Quality

1. **Good Context**:
   - Specific problem statement
   - Clear constraints
   - Measurable drivers

2. **Good Options**:
   - ≥2 distinct alternatives
   - Each option viable
   - Trade-offs clear

3. **Good Rationale**:
   - Clear reasoning
   - References decision drivers
   - Acknowledges trade-offs
   - Honest about cons

### FDD Integration

1. **Link to design elements**:
   - Always include Related Design Elements section
   - Link to relevant actors, capabilities, requirements, principles
   - Use specific IDs, not generic references

2. **Update when**:
   - Implementing the decision (Status: Accepted)
   - Superseding with new ADR
   - Deprecating without replacement

3. **Cross-reference**:
   - Reference ADRs in DESIGN.md where relevant
   - Reference ADRs in feature designs
   - Use ADR number: ADR-NNNN

## Complete Example

```markdown
# Analytics - Architecture Decision Records

**Module**: Analytics  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-31

This document tracks all significant architectural decisions for the Analytics module.

---

## ADR-0001: Initial Analytics Architecture

**Date**: 2025-12-31  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Hyperspot Team  
**Technical Story**: Analytics module initialization

### Context and Problem Statement

The Hyperspot platform required a comprehensive analytics solution that could:
- Support multiple data sources without vendor lock-in
- Provide type-safe data visualization and querying
- Ensure complete tenant isolation in multi-tenant environment
- Scale horizontally while maintaining performance

### Decision Drivers

- **Type Safety**: Need compile-time and runtime type validation
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Complete tenant isolation is mandatory
- **Data Agnostic**: No vendor lock-in to specific DWH
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for datasources
- **Performance**: Sub-second query response times

### Considered Options

1. **GTS + Plugin Architecture** (chosen)
2. **Monolithic with Built-in DWH**
3. **Microservices with Dedicated Query Service**

### Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "GTS + Plugin Architecture"

**Rationale**: GTS provides runtime type validation with plugin architecture 
allowing adding datasources without service restart. SecurityCtx enforced at 
compilation via Secure ORM ensures tenant isolation.

**Positive Consequences**:
- No vendor lock-in
- Type-safe communication through GTS
- Plugin registration without service restart
- Complete tenant isolation via SecurityCtx

**Negative Consequences**:
- More complex architecture than monolithic
- Plugin development requires understanding of GTS
- Query performance depends on external sources

- `fdd-analytics-capability-extensibility` - Dynamic datasource registration

**Requirements**:
- `fdd-analytics-req-performance` - Query execution performance
- `fdd-analytics-req-security` - Multi-tenant isolation

**Principles**:
- `fdd-analytics-principle-plugin-extensibility` - No service restart required
- `fdd-analytics-principle-gts-native` - All plugin communication via GTS
- `fdd-analytics-principle-data-agnostic` - No built-in DWH
