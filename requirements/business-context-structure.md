   - Keep capability scope broad but coherent
   - List actor IDs that use each capability

4. **Success criteria**
   - Make them measurable
   - Include quantitative targets
   - Focus on business outcomes

## Examples

**Valid BUSINESS.md structure**:
```markdown
# Business Context

## A. Vision

Provide analytics platform for tracking user behavior...

## B. Actors

**Human Actors**:

#### Admin User
- **ID**: `fdd-hyperspot-actor-admin-user`
- **Role**: Administrator managing the system configuration and access

#### Data Analyst
- **ID**: `fdd-hyperspot-actor-data-analyst`
- **Role**: Analyzes user behavior and usage metrics

**System Actors**:

#### UI Application
- **ID**: `fdd-hyperspot-actor-ui-app`
- **Role**: Frontend application used by human actors

## C. Capabilities

#### Analytics Dashboard
- **ID**: `fdd-hyperspot-capability-analytics-dashboard`
- View and analyze key user behavior metrics
- Filter metrics by tenant, time range, and segments

**Actors**: `fdd-hyperspot-actor-admin-user`, `fdd-hyperspot-actor-data-analyst`

#### Usage Analytics
- **ID**: `fdd-hyperspot-capability-usage-analytics`
- Track usage events and aggregate metrics

**Actors**: `fdd-hyperspot-actor-data-analyst`, `fdd-hyperspot-actor-ui-app`
```

**Invalid BUSINESS.md**:
```markdown
# Business Stuff

Some information about the business.

We have users and admins.

## Actors

Admin
ID: fdd-actor-admin
```

**Issues**:
- Missing required section structure (A/B/C headings and required content)
- Actor headings must be `####` and grouped by Human/System actors
- Actor IDs use wrong format (must be `fdd-{project-name}-actor-{actor-name}`) and must be wrapped in backticks
- Actor metadata should be formatted as separate render-safe lines (prefer markdown lists)
- Capabilities section is missing (no capability IDs, no actor references)
