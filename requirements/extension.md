# FDD Extension Mechanism

## Prerequisite Checklist

- [ ] Agent understands extension mechanism concept
- [ ] Agent has identified the base file being extended

---

## Overview

**Extension mechanism** - Allows files to inherit content from base files and add modifications

**Format**: `**Extends**: {path-to-base-file}`

**Applies to**: AGENTS.md, specification files, requirements files

---

## How Extends Works

### Basic Rule

**When file has `**Extends**: {base-file}`**:

1. Load base file first
2. Load current file
3. Merge = base content + current modifications
4. Never skip base
5. Never replace base rules entirely

### Loading Order

```
Base File (loaded first)
    ↓
Current File (loaded second)
    ↓
Merged Result (base + modifications)
```

### Merge Behavior

**Base content** is ALWAYS included

**Current file** can:
- ✅ Add new sections
- ✅ Add new rules
- ✅ Add new instructions
- ✅ Override specific values (if explicitly stated)
- ❌ Remove base rules
- ❌ Contradict base principles

---

## Examples

### Valid Extension

**Base**: `FDD/AGENTS.md`
```markdown
See [PRD.md](PRD.md)
See [ADR](ADR/)
See [api.json](../../../docs/api/api.json)
```
ALWAYS open and follow `.adapter/specs/conventions.md` WHEN modifying FDD files
```

**Extension**: `{adapter-directory}/AGENTS.md`
```markdown
# Project AI Agent Navigation

**Extends**: `../FDD/AGENTS.md`

ALWAYS open and follow `{adapter-directory}/domain-model.gts` WHEN executing workflows: design/, design-validate/, adr/, adr-validate/
ALWAYS open and follow `{adapter-directory}/api-contracts.yaml` WHEN executing workflows: design.md, design-validate.md, adr.md, adr-validate.md
```

**Result**: Agent reads FDD/AGENTS.md first, then adds project-specific instructions

### Invalid Extension

```markdown
# Project AI Agent Navigation

**Extends**: `../FDD/AGENTS.md`

# This contradicts base - INVALID
DO NOT read requirements files
```

---

## Extension Rules

**MUST**:
- Specify exact path to base file
- Load base file before processing current file
- Preserve all base rules and instructions
- Add modifications that complement base

**MUST NOT**:
- Skip loading base file
- Remove base rules
- Contradict base principles
- Create circular dependencies (A extends B, B extends A)

---

## Use Cases

### AGENTS.md Extension

**Base**: Core FDD navigation  
**Extension**: Project-specific navigation (domain model, API contracts, tech stack)

### Requirements Extension

**Base**: General structure requirements  
**Extension**: Project-specific validation rules

### Specification Extension

**Base**: Core syntax/grammar  
**Extension**: Project-specific extensions to syntax

---

## Validation Criteria

### Structure

**Check**:
- [ ] **Extends** directive present in header
- [ ] Base file path specified correctly
- [ ] Path format is correct (relative or absolute)
- [ ] Extension file has proper header

### Base File Accessibility

**Check**:
- [ ] Base file exists at specified path
- [ ] Base file is readable
- [ ] Base file path is correct relative to extension file location
- [ ] No broken references

### Merge Correctness

**Check**:
- [ ] Extension adds new content (not just duplicates)
- [ ] Extension doesn't contradict base rules
- [ ] Extension doesn't remove base content
- [ ] Extension complements base appropriately

### Dependency Validation

**Check**:
- [ ] No circular dependencies (A→B→A)
- [ ] Base file is loaded before extension
- [ ] Extension chain is finite
- [ ] All base files in chain are accessible

---

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Extension has valid **Extends** directive
- [ ] Base file exists and is accessible
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Extension complements (not contradicts) base
